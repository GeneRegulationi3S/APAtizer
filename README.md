# Description
APAtizer is a tool designed to analyse alternative polyadenylation of RNA-Seq data. Additionally, it is capable of performing differential gene expression, gene ontology analysis, visualizing Venn diagram intersections and Pearson correlation analysis. APAtizer is equipped to handle BAM files, DaPars txt files and htseq files. It is a user-friendly interface, that allows users to generate informative visualizations, including volcano plots, heatmaps, Venn intersections and gene lists. The APAtizer tool also provides the functionality to download the aforementioned plots and gene lists for further analysis and exploration. 

# Workflow
![image](https://github.com/brss12/APAtizer/assets/121204829/02d6eb3a-6bd1-47f1-9c40-b0a9ec19af1d)


# Installing dependencies
To install the required command line tools for the creation of the input files necessary to use APAtizer, the user must run the [install_dependencies_linux.sh](install_dependencies_linux.sh) script for linux or run the [install_dependencies_macos.sh](install_dependencies_macos.sh) script for macOS.
```shell
./install_dependencies_linux.sh #Linux
```
```shell
./install_dependencies_macos.sh #MacOS
```

# Creating the input files
The script to create the input files requires the raw BAM files to be placed in a folder called **RAW_BAM**. To start, clone the repository in the same directory of the **RAW_BAM** and enter the folder with the following commands.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/brss12/APAtizer.git && cd APAtizer
```

After this, you will find a file called [create_inputs.sh](create_inputs.sh). Run it using the following command.

```shell
chmod +x create_inputs.sh && ./create_inputs.sh
```

This script will prompt the user to select the number (1-4) corresponding to the genome version used in the creation of the BAM files. This will be essencial for the creation of the input files necessary for APAtizer.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0386d9d-9767-4bd5-be45-e16aaca687ad)

Upon selecting the number, the snakemake workflow scripts for the genome version chosen by the user will automatically run and create the input files necessary for the analysis in APAtizer. This script automatically sorts and removes the duplicates from the raw BAM files required for the APA analysis using the APAlyzer algorithm, creates the DaPars txt files required for APA analysis employing the DaPars algorithm and it also creates the htseq files required for the DGE analysis using the DESeq2 package. All of these downstream analysis take place in the APAtizer's user interface.

After finishing running, the folders **TRIMMED_READS**, **TRIMMED_QC**, **TRIMMED_htseq** and **DaPars_data** are created. In the **TRIMMED_READS** folder, is where the de-duplicated BAM files along with the corresponding BAI index files are located. In the **TRIMMED_QC** folder, is where the fastqc reports of the de-duplicated BAM files are located for the user to obtain information about the number of reads, length of reads and many more parameters about the BAM files. In the **TRIMMED_htseq** folder is where the htseq files for the DGE analysis are located. Finally, in the **DaPars_data** folder, is where the txt files necessary for the DaPars analysis are located.

Also, it is important to mention that depending on the size and ammount of BAM files, we recommend performing the aforementioned steps in a HPC environment.

***All done! Now you are ready to use APAtizer!***

To run the tool, the user can run the R script [APAtizer.R](APAtizer.R) using the following command or open the file on RStudio and press "Run App".

```shell
Rscript APAtizer.R
```

Now, to showcase the capabilities of APAtizer, we performed three case studies using our tool. 

The first one was done on 3'mRNA-Seq data from 8 samples (4 Tumour samples and 4 Normal samples) that were retrieved from patients of IPO-Porto (Instituto PortuguÃªs Oncologia do Porto). The FASTQ files were obtained via Illumina sequencing technologies and were aligned to the hg38 reference genome to obtain raw BAM files that were put through our snakemake workflow with [create_inputs.sh](create_inputs.sh). Our aim with this case study was to showcase that APAtizer can not only work with data from standard RNA-Seq but also with 3'mRNA-Seq data. The latter is a type of sequencing more suitable for APA event quantification.

The second one was done on standard RNA-Seq data from 8 samples (4 samples from Heart and 4 samples from Testis) of Mouse retrieved from GEO (GSM900199 and GSM900193 accession numbers). The FASTQ files were obtained via Illumina sequencing technologies and were aligned to the mm9 reference genome to obtain raw BAM files that were processed via our snakemake workflow to create the inputs necessary for APAtizer. Our aim with this case study was to show to the users that, in addition to Human RNA-Seq data, APAtizer can also work with RNA-Seq data derived from Mouse.

The third case study was done on standard RNA-Seq data from 4 samples (2 samples from DEN WT and 2 samples from WT) of Mouse also retrieved from NCBI (PRJNA214241 BioProject). The FASTQ files were obtained via Ion Torrent sequencing technologies and were once again aligned to the mm9 reference genome to obtain raw BAM files that were processed using our snakemake workflow script to create the inputs necessary for APAtizer. Our aim with this final case study was to showcase that the APAtizer tool, while working with Illumina sequencing technologies, can also work with Ion Torrent sequencing technologies which is a more recent approach compared to Illumina and also produces sequencing reads with different lengths.

Below, we showcase a walkthrough of the APAtizer tool showing the different tabs, inputs and outputs that can be obtained by the user.

## Sample Sheet interface
### Creating the sample sheet
In this section, the user may start by creating the sample sheet by clicking on the **Add row** button to add the necessary number of rows to construct the sample sheet. This sample sheet consists of two columns called **File.Name** and **Sample.Type**. The first column indicated the name of the BAM files and the second column indicated the name of the corresponding condition. An example of a sample sheet for this case study is shown below.

In APA_APALYZER, in the input space the user may paste the full path of the folder **TRIMMED_READS** that contains all the de-duplicated BAM files and the index files. The user can also select the reference PAS for the analysis (hg19, hg38, mm9 and mm10), select the sequencing method (paired-end and single-end) and also select the strandedness of the BAM files (forward stranded, reverse stranded or non-stranded). The user may also select the output types of the analysis such as the lists that are displayed and the plots. For the lists, the user can choose between 3'UTR APA lengthening (*NvsT_APA_UP*), 3'UTR APA shortening (*NvsT_APA_DN*) and non-significant (*NvsT_APA_NC*). In the case of the plots, the choice is between a Volcano plot with the top 40 significant genes highlighted (*APA Volcano Plot (top40)*), the same plot but with no highlights (*APA Volcano Plot*) and a box plot (*APA Box*).

In the output space, in the tab called *Number of APA events* one can see a small table where the number of non significant, lengthening and shortening genes is present.

For colon cancer, we can also see that we have a significant negative correlation between IPA and DGE events. Genes that undergo IPA downregulation are being more expressed, whereas genes that undergo IPA upregulation are being less expressed.

# Final remarks
In this README, three case studies were used to demonstrate and explain the features and capabilities of the APAtizer tool. With this tool, the user can analyze RNA-Seq data from various sources and retrieve many plots and useful information regarding 3'UTR APA & IPA events via DaPars2 and APAlyzer analysis, DGE via DESeq2, the function of those genes via GO analysis, the common genes between cancers using Venn diagram intersections and the correlation between 3'UTR APA & IPA events and DGE via Pearson correlation analysis scatter plots.
